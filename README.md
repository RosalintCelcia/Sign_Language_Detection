# Sign_Language_Detection
This repository contains the implementation of a Sign Language Detection system using Deep Learning techniques. The project aims to classify American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets (A-Y, excluding J) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras.
# üìã Overview
The project demonstrates:

Preprocessing of the Sign Language MNIST dataset for training, validation, and testing.
Implementation of a custom CNN model for image classification.
Model training with performance evaluation, including accuracy metrics, loss curves, and classification reports.
Visualization of sample predictions and model architecture.
üõ† Features
Data Augmentation: Enhance dataset variety for robust model training.
Custom CNN Architecture: Includes layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Batch Normalization for optimal performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides detailed analysis through confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy/loss plots.
Model Visualization: Visualize the model architecture using visualkeras and TensorFlow.
üöÄ Technologies Used
Languages: Python
Libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, VisualKeras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
üìÇ Dataset
The project uses the Sign Language MNIST dataset, a modified version of the original MNIST dataset, adapted for American Sign Language alphabets.
Dataset Link: Sign Language MNIST on Kaggle
üéØ How It Works
Dataset Preprocessing:
Data normalization and reshaping.
Adjusting class labels for compatibility.
Model Training:
A PyTorch-based CNN architecture with dropout and ReLU activations.
Batch processing with custom DataLoader configurations.
Evaluation:
Compare training and validation performance over epochs.
Evaluate the test dataset with a detailed classification report.
Visualization:
Plot training/validation loss and accuracy curves.
Display random test predictions with true and predicted labels.
