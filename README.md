# Sign_Language_Detection
This repository contains the implementation of a Sign Language Detection system using Deep Learning techniques. The project aims to classify American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets (A-Y, excluding J) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras.
# üìã Overview
The project demonstrates:
  - Preprocessing of the Sign Language MNIST dataset for training, validation, and testing.
  - Implementation of a custom CNN model for image classification.
  - Model training with performance evaluation, including accuracy metrics, loss curves, and classification reports.
  - Visualization of sample predictions and model architecture.
    
# üõ† Features
  - Data Augmentation: Enhance dataset variety for robust model training.
  - Custom CNN Architecture: Includes layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Batch Normalization for optimal performance.
  - Evaluation Metrics: Provides detailed analysis through confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy/loss plots.
  - Model Visualization: Visualize the model architecture using visualkeras and TensorFlow.

# üöÄ Technologies Used
  - Languages: Python
  - Libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, VisualKeras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.

# üìÇ Dataset
  - The project uses the Sign Language MNIST dataset, a modified version of the original MNIST dataset, adapted for American Sign Language alphabets.
  - Dataset Link: Sign Language MNIST on Kaggle

# üéØ How It Works
1.Dataset Preprocessing:
  - Data normalization and reshaping.
  - Adjusting class labels for compatibility.
2.Model Training:
  - A PyTorch-based CNN architecture with dropout and ReLU activations.
  - Batch processing with custom DataLoader configurations.
3.Evaluation:
  - Compare training and validation performance over epochs.
  - Evaluate the test dataset with a detailed classification report.
4.Visualization:
  - Plot training/validation loss and accuracy curves.
  - Display random test predictions with true and predicted labels.
